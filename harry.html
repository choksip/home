			<h1> Harry Edward Styles </h1>
			<h2> Early Life </h2>
			<p>
				Harry Styles was born in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, in the West Midlands region of England, on February 1, 1994. When he was seven years old, his parents, Des and Anne, split. He and his sister Gemma were raised by their mother in the Cheshire town of Holmes Chapel. His mother remarried to Robin Twist later in life. Styles went to Holmes Chapel Comprehensive School, where he established the band White Eskimo with three of his mates. Styles was the lead singer for White Eskimo, and the band was successful enough at their school to win a band competition. Styles worked at the W. Mandeville bakery in Holmes Chapel after school and on weekends.

			<h2> Personal Life </h2>
			<p>
				Styles&rsquo; sexual relationships were constantly tracked by the press and fans as he ascended to stardom, earning him the nickname &quot;the flirt&quot; of One Direction. He began dating Caroline Flack, a television presenter, in 2011, when he was competing on The X Factor and she was hosting its spin&#45;off show, The Xtra Factor. The age gap between them&#45;Styles was 17 at the time, while Flack was 32&#45;became a point of contention. Styles was later linked to photographer Sarah&#45;Louise Colivet, models Emma Ostilly and Cara Delevingne, and singers Lily Halpern and Rita Ora in a love relationship. His most well&#45;known relationship in 2012 was a two&#45;month relationship with music artist Taylor Swift, which purportedly inspired two of Swift's songs. Styles later dated Camille Rowe, a French model.
