			<h1> Liam James Payne </h1>
			<h2> Early Life </h2>
			<p>
				Geoff and Karen Payne raised Liam in Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England. Liam was born three weeks early, and as a result, he had a lot of health issues as a baby. He was in and out of hospitals for the first four years of his life, requiring regular testing. Doctors later discovered that one of his kidneys had scarring and was no longer functioning. Liam required 32 injections in his arm every day to help him cope with the discomfort. Liam discovered that his kidney was fully functional again in 2012.
