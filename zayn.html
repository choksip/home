			<h2> Personal Life </h2>
			<p>
				Malik was known as the bad boy of One Direction owing to his unruly demeanour, numerous tattoos, and his dyed, pompadour&#45;like haircut. He dated Geneva Lane, Rebecca Ferguson, and Perrie Edwards, all former X Factor contestants, after initially breaking into the spotlight. Malik was engaged to Perrie Edwards, a member of the girl group Little Mix, in August 2013. Two years later, the couple called it quits. Late in 2015, Malik began dating model Gigi Hadid. Following a breakup in March 2018, the couple reconciled in late 2019. Malik and Hadid expected their first child together in April 2020. Khai, their daughter, was born in September but not soon after,  Malik and Hadid were soon back to being single with only a civil relationship between them, one that is there for the sake of their daughter.
