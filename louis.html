			<h1> Louis William Tomlinson </h1>
			<h2> Early Life </h2>
			<p>
				Louis Tomlinson was born in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, England, on December 24, 1991. His parents, Johannah and Troy Austin, split when he was young, and he adopted the last name of his stepfather, Mark Tomlinson. Georgia, Charlotte, F&eacute;licit&eacute;, and twins Daisy and Phoebe were Tomlinson's half&#45;sisters when he was growing up. Later, his mother and stepfather split. In 2014, Tomlinson's family grew again as his mother and husband Daniel Deakin welcomed another set of twins, Ernest and Doris. Tomlinson attended The Hayfield School in Doncaster, and after failing to graduate, he finished his education at Hall Cross Academy. He was a part of various school plays, including the musical Grease, while at Hall Cross. He did part&#45;time jobs in retail and at Doncaster Rovers Football Club outside of school.
