			<h1> The Creation Of One Direction </h1>
			<p>
				One direction had no plans of being One direction at all in 2010 when they had first auditioned on the X Factor, a reality&#45;competition show for singers that want to compete to become the next big singing sensation and crowned &quot;The X Factor&quot; Champion. They all came on stage with hopes of being a one man act, an act that would hopefully steal the nations heart, but ended up being a five man act, an act that stole not only the nations hearts, but the worlds. Zayn Malik had auditioned with the song Let me love you by Mario at the age of 17, Niall Horan had sang So Sick by Ne&#45;Yo at 16, 18&#45;year&#45;old Louis Tomlinson sang Hey There Delilah by Plain White T&rsquo;s, Liam Payne, at 16, auditioned with the song Cry Me A River by Michael Buble, a large contrast to Frank Sinatra&rsquo;s &quot;Fly Me To The Moon&quot; that he had auditioned with in the 2008 X Factor when he was just 14. He had sadly not made it past the second level and was kicked out of judge Simon Cowel&rsquo;s house in Barbados. And finally, Harry Styles joined the stage at the ripe age of 16 and sang Isn&rsquo;t She Lovely by the wonderful Stevie Wonder. The boys made it to the boot camp stage but were sadly told that they could no longer continue on the show, but that situation was able to turn itself around very quickly as Simon Cowel believed that these boys were just too good to be kicked out. While many believe that Simon Cowel is the one to have made the decision to band these boys together, it was actually guest judge, Pussycat Doll Nicole Scherzinger that thought of the idea to put these boys together at the X Factor Bootcamp. They had all loved the idea of staying on the show for a longer period so they decided to take the risk and get together as a band. They finally met for the first time and when asked what they were going to call themselves, Harry had suggested that since they all wanted to go in one direction (to the top) they should call themselves just that. That moment marked the beginning of their musical journey.
